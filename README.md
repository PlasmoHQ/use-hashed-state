# use-hashed-state

`use-hashed-state` is a hook library from [plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) to safely store data in localstorage with an unique key of `any` type, even a component.

The library is a typescript fork of [use-persisted-state-hook](https://github.com/giovannibenussi/use-persisted-state-hook) but instead of `md5`, is uses `node-object-hash`, and it hashes both the key and the values.

## Example

The `Check` component below is capable of having a state simply based on the content of its children - it is fully independent.

```tsx
import { useHashedState } from "use-hashed-state"

const Check = ({ children = "" as ReactNode }) => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useHashedState<boolean>(
    children,
    false,
    "plasmo-soc2"
  )
  return (
    <Checkbox checked={checked} onChange={() => setChecked((c) => !c)}>
      {children}
    </Checkbox>
  )
}

// Consume in another component:
const Container = () => (
  <>
    <Check>
      <WaveIcon /> Waved
    </Check>
    <Check>
      <ClockTick />
    </Check>
  </>
)
```
